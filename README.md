# Computer Vision Project - Fruits & Vegetables Classifier
### By: Shmuel Fainberg & Lior Gal

Our goal for this project is to create a PyTorch based computer vision model, dedicated to identifying & classifying a large variety of fruits & vegetables.

To achieve this goal, our project will include all the necessary steps including creating and training a CNN-based deep learning model, working with a large dataset of labeled images, 
handling input images for classification and testing.
